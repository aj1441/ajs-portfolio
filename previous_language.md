## old About me
Bringing over a decade of cross-functional experience in administration, supply chain logistics, program oversight, and marketing, I began formally pivoting into the tech space in 2018. My interest in cybersecurity and digital privacy stems from firsthand encounters, motivating me to stay deeply engaged with evolving best practices. I'm consistently expanding my knowledge of AI integration for task automation, security enhancement, and data-driven decision-making. As someone who understands both operational complexity and technical growth, I offer a unique perspective and dependable versatility to any development team.
