          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p className={styles.highlight}>
            Software development, marketing, AI, and project leadership are my
            tools for transformation. I build not just code, but strategies and
            experiences that engage, protect, and INSPIRE!
          </p>
          <p>
            Bringing over a decade of cross-functional experience in
            administration, supply chain logistics, program oversight, and
            marketing, I began formally pivoting into the tech space in 2018. My
            passion for cybersecurity and digital privacy stems from firsthand
            experience, fueling a deep commitment to staying at the forefront of
            evolving technologies.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I don't just solve problems â€” I create new possibilities. With sharp
            foresight, multidimensional experience, and a relentless drive, I
            chart paths where others see roadblocks. My strategic,
            unconventional approach allows me to anticipate challenges, design
            bold solutions, and drive lasting impact. Bridging operational
            complexity with technical innovation, I bring a decisive,
            future-focused mindset and dependable execution to every development
            team I join.
